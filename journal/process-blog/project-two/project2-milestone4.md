# Project Two

### Milestone Four

I really liked learning THREE.js. For me, adding an extra dimension to a webpage makes the payoff more satisfying and more fun. 

I did end up pivoting a little about halfway through. My initial plan was to have the project be more interactive and less static, with the data changing along with the user's input. I had also been planning on displaying temperature data, rather than CO2 emissions, but once I decided to cut back on the interactivity, the temperature data felt pretty uninteresting. 

I was able to read in the data and organize it into vectors of the latitude, longitude, and CO2 emission per location, and then map the data onto the sphere as shapes. My computer was having a hard time rendering everything, so I limited it to only display the data point if the CO2 emission was above a certain value. Some roadblocks I ran into were easily overcome, and some were more difficult. For some reason I had a hard time getting certain textures to show up, which was a bit limiting, and I never figured out why some images wouldn't display. I worked around this pretty easily by taking time to find images that worked and also that I liked. The computer limitations were harder to work around, and I mostly worked around this by decreasing the amount of geometry the program rendered.

I liked how this turned out in the end, but I think a lot could be added to it.
