# Project Two

### Milestone One

For the second project I’d like to try and learn three.js.

I think it could be really cool to render a globe with some interaction based on predicted temperature for the next fifty or so years. I’d like to have the user have control over the year they’re seeing, maybe with a slider or a text box, or maybe just based on mouse position or scroll to keep the page from being cluttered.

I had a surprisingly hard time finding a dataset for climate projections. I found a few that have data on changes in averages in the past, and there are a ton of models and articles on predicted future temperatures, but I only found one site that had the data available to download.
It includes a lot of additional information too, such as predicted precipitation levels and change in the number of days that break both high and low temperature records. If at all possible, I’d like to find a way to include some of that instead, but depending on how many things go wrong it might be a reach.

I’ve never worked with three.js so I imagine I’ll run into a lot of roadblocks, but I think at the very least I’ll be able to get a globe to react to the user’s input and display data for the input year. Ideally, I’d like to display more than just the temperature. It would be cool to have air quality and humidity data as well, or possibly even the shift in permafrost and ocean levels, although that might be too ambitious.
I’m not sure if I would need to include a library to deal with maps, or if I could just map the sphere based on latitude and longitude, but I included some options for mapping libraries in case I need them.

To make this compatible with different sized webpages, I'll ideally have the globe's size be set to a fraction of the screen size.
