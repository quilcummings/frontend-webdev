# Project Two

### Milestone Two

I’m not quite as far as I’d like to be on this. I was fighting with the textures for awhile, but I currently have a globe that is textured, as well as a textured background. The sphere and camera both react to the mouse position, and the globe rotates on its own.

The big thing I still have to add is the data, which is probably going to be the most difficult part. I have had some issues with parcel throwing errors when I close and reopen the project, as well as some issues with the UV map for the globe, so I’ve spent a lot more time trying to solve problems than making progress. I’m thinking it might be easier to display some constant data rather than have the image change based on an input year. Depending on how quickly the rest of this goes, I may end up displaying CO2 emissions by country, rather than climate projections. This would allow me to focus more of my time on making it look good and work well, rather than adding additional interactions. 

If I have enough time left once I get that working, the next step would be adding more interactions and additional data.
