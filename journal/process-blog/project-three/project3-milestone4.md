# Project Three

### Milestone Four

Working with React was an interesting experience. The syntax was very unfamiliar and there were points of serious frustration as I struggled to figure out how to do things that would have taken me minutes in plain javascript. That being said, I overall enjoyed working on this project. Working with other people can be hit or miss but I had a good time figuring things out with Sandy, and I definitely learned a lot about how to (and how not to) use React along the way. 

Some of the issues we ran into were being unable to figure out how to access the state from another class, as well as getting the whole card object to flip over when activated, rather than just the images. For the state, we worked around this by accessing a variable in the css file, and for the flipping of the card it just took a lot of trial and error.

Due to a few hangups we weren't able to implement all of our ideas, but I think what we ended up with was clean and fun. This is the kind of project it would be fun to add onto at a later date, and I think there is a lot of room for expansion. Making games with frontend languages like html and css is a fun challenge, and I had a really good time working on this.
