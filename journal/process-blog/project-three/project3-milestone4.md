# Project Three

### Milestone Four

Working with React was an interesting experience. The syntax was very unfamiliar and there were points of serious frustration as I struggled to figure out how to do things that would have taken me minutes in plain javascript. That being said, I overall enjoyed working on this project. Working with other people can be hit or miss but I had a good time figuring things out with Sandy, and I definitely learned a lot about how to (and how not to) use React along the way.

Due to a few hangups we weren't able to implement all of our ideas, but I think what we ended up with was clean and fun. This is the kind of project it would be fun to add onto at a later date, and I think there is a lot of room for expansion. Making games with frontend languages like html and css is a fun challenge, and I had a really good time working on this.
