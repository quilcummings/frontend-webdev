# Project Three

### Milestone One

I’m going to be working with Sandy Lee on this project. We are planning to make a React app with a few simple games: a card game in which the player flips over cards two at a time and tries to find the matches, a dice game in which the players roll to get a higher number than the computer, and possibly a coin flip.

As a proof of concept, we’ll ideally have at least the basics of a card game, and a 2D dice game. The MVP will look a lot cleaner and hopefully include another game or two. 

I really like the idea of adding 3D physics and being able to roll dice on the screen. I’m not really sure if this would be feasible within a React app, but as a stretch goal it’s something I want to look into a little more and try to figure out. 

The idea is for this to just be a fun thing for people to interact with, and there isn’t really a greater purpose. I think it’s important that it looks good and clean and that the movement is smooth, so even if the games are simple the experience is still enjoyable. The intended audience for this is pretty much anyone. These games are going to be fairly easy and very straightforward, so really anyone who can use a computer would most likely be a good audience for it. 

We’ll probably be referring a lot to the React.js documentation.
